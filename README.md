# RayBanProject
RayBanProject emailer call to button and a landing page
The purpose of the particular work is to enable a call to action button so that users can fill in a form that therefore get notified about RayBan sunglasses promotes and offers. 
Afterwards, the goal is to send data through POST method. In addition, data are sent to a server which is specified into the Angular JS web application. Data are therefore sent through HTTP 
protocol to a PHP file into the server. Furthermore, they are stored into the database through INSERT operation in SQL. In order to retrieve the data, HTTP requests are sent from the SQL-PHP Back-End 
environment to the Front-End so that models, controllers and views are displayed the data o the user. 
Apart from that, I have also achieved to deploy a very very simple website through AWS services that can be found in the following link: http://my-super-unique-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
